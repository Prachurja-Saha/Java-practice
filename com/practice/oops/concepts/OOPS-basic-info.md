Advantage of OOPS over Procedure-oriented
1) OOPs makes development and maintenance easier, whereas, in a procedure-oriented programming language, 
it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size increases.
2) OOPs provides data hiding, whereas, in a procedure-oriented programming language, 
global data can be accessed from anywhere.

# Note 1
constructor return current class instance (You cannot use return type yet it returns a value).
Class1 class1 = new Class1();

# ABSTRACTION
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java
* Abstract Class
  An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
  It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
  It cannot be instantiated.
  It can have constructors and static methods also.
  It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.
