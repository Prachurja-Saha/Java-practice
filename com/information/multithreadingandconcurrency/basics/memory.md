# Computer Memory
2 types
1. Primary memory [ Main memory directly communicates with CPU ]
   3 types [RAM, ROM, Cache Memory]
2. Secondary memory [ Provides backup/permanent storage i.e Hard Disk, pend-rive, floppy disk, HDD etc]


# ROM -> Read Only Memory
1. Inbuilt software provided by computer company  i.e. (Asus, Hp etc.)
2. Whatever the instruction provided by company it cannot be changed, so it is permanent 
3. Data Will not change inside ROM so its Non Volatile.
   Not only in computer can be anywhere i.e. washing machine, car, Microwave, Remote fridge etc.

Type of ROM 
1. PROM -> Programmable ROM - programmed by company [Data will not change]
2. EPROM -> Before there is only PROM in Hardware, due to PROM they can't change it, so they create this.
            [i.e. company wants to change the logo] now they can use EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM).
            Now this can be changed but problem is very difficult we have to extract ROM from mother board
            and then using ultraviolet ray we will remove the previous data and add new data.
            so the solution of this is -> EEPROM (modified version of EPROM)
3. EEPROM -> Using electromagnetic/ current way we can change data no need to extract ROM from mother board


# RAM -> Random Access Memory
# When we download file it will store in HARD DISK DRIVE (Short Hard Drive) -> Secondary memory
If I want to perform a task [i.e. opening a file from hard disk drive] that memory of file is stored in RAM
[Fast, High Price, Memory volatile means after u switch off u r device RAM memory will be removed, more RAM memory
   more task can be performed at a time.]
When We save our work in RAM it stores in Hard Drive. 1st time -> save as, 2nd time -> save 


2 Types
1. DRAM -> Dynamic RAM (Our works done here)
2. SRAM -> Static RAM (static will not change i.e. Calendar, Watch) its not in ROM we can change the time and date

Advanced version -> DDR1, DDR2... DDR4 -> latest upgraded version of RAM


`Hard Disk Drive -> large size, speed less, more consumption of battery, if any crack -> Data loss
so engineer creates SSD -> Speed high, less battery consuption, high price `


# Cache Memory
stores software, resource which we used most/ everytime very less memory i.e. 2MB, 4MB
