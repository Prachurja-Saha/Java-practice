# CPU -> Central Processing Unit i.e Intel, AMDA
Processor -> Performing a task. (we need to perform task using logically, Arithmetically and also using memory)
Arithmetic and logical unit, memory unit, control unit

Inside processor there is core more no. of core better performance.
Processor size is same but core size is decreasing and increasing the no. (this tech is known as nanotechnology)
`if we divide the core, system can perform multiple task`

# single-core CPU can perform multiple tasks, but not simultaneously.
# It uses a technique called time-sharing or context switching to create the illusion of concurrent task execution.
When was there is single core -> Task continuously switching b/w one and other
Processor/CPU: {[Core1{ Task1[Thread1, Thread2]}, Core2{ Task[Thread1]}]}

Multitasking -> Multiple process run simultaneously. Process -> Task (i.e. video play, song play etc.)
