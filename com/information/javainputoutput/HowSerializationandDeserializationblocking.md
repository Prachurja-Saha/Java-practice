# Serialization and deserialization in Java are generally synchronous and blocking. (block current thread) 
This means that when an object is being serialized (converted to a byte stream) or 
deserialized (reconstructed from a byte stream), the process occurs in a single thread and blocks other 
operations until it is complete.
`When we say the current thread is blocked during serialization, it means that the thread is busy performing the 
serialization process and can't perform any other tasks until it completes. In simpler terms, the same thread that's 
executing the code is the one doing the serialization, and it's unable to do anything else during this time.`

# Here's a brief overview:
Serialization: The process of converting an object into a byte stream for storage or transmission.
Deserialization: The process of reconstructing an object from a byte stream.

During serialization and deserialization:
The current thread performing these operations will be blocked until the process is complete.
This ensures data integrity but may lead to performance bottlenecks in applications where large objects or 
numerous objects need to be serialized/deserialized.
If you need non-blocking serialization or deserialization, you might consider using asynchronous I/O 
(such as Java's NIO package) or libraries designed for non-blocking operations. However, 
implementing these solutions can be more complex and requires careful handling to maintain data consistency.
