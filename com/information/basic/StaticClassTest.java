* what i know static has only one memory?
You're right that static fields and methods in a class have only one instance in memory,
*  which is shared among all instances of that class. However, when it comes to static inner classes, it's a bit different.

Static Inner Classes:
static inner classes are nested classes that do not have a reference to an instance of their enclosing class.
They can have their own instances and do not share state like static fields/methods do.

When you create instances of a static inner class, each instance is independent. For example:
*
* public class OuterClass {
    public static class StaticInnerClass {
        private String value;

        public StaticInnerClass(String value) {
            this.value = value;
        }

        public String getValue() {
            return value;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StaticInnerClass instance1 = new StaticInnerClass("Value1");
        StaticInnerClass instance2 = new StaticInnerClass("Value2");

        System.out.println(instance1.getValue()); // Output: Value1
        System.out.println(instance2.getValue()); // Output: Value2
    }
}
