In Java, string is basically an object that represents sequence of char values. 
An array of characters works same as Java string

char[] ch={'j','a','v','a','t','p','o','i','n','t'};  
String s=new String(ch); 


# String Class is final which means we cannot extends String class and cannot override any method
