# Notes
* Branching in Git allows you to create separate versions of your project where you can work on different features, 
  fixes, or experiments in parallel without affecting the main codebase. 
* Feature Branches: These branches are created to work on specific features or fixes 
  (e.g., feature-login, bugfix-123).
* Hotfix Branches: For immediate fixes on production code.

# GIT COMMANDS
* Create Branch                           Command : [git branch <branch-name>] example: git branch feature-login
* Switching to a Branch (Checkout)        Command : [git checkout <branch-name>]
* See all the branches in your repository Command : [git branch]
* View Branch History                     Command : [git log]
* Deleting a Branch                       Command : [git branch -d <branch-name>]

`MERGING`
* After making changes in a branch, you may want to merge it back into another branch steps:
1. First, switch to the branch you want to merge into Command [git checkout <branch-where-I-want-to-merge>]
2. Then merge the other branch Command: [git merge <my-branch>]
* After merging a branch, it’s often good practice to delete it if it’s no longer needed

`Steps to Create a New Branch from an Existing Branch`
1. Switch to the Existing Branch             Command : [git checkout <Existing Branch>]
2. Create and Switch to the New Branch       Command : [git checkout -b <New Branch>]
3. Verify the Branch Switch                  Command : [git branch]
4. Push the New Branch to Remote (if needed) Command : [git push -u origin <New Branch>]
