# NOTES
- Authentication is required when you perform actions that change the state of the
  remote repository (like pushing changes).
- Credential Management: If you provide your username and PAT, Git may offer to cache these credentials so that
  you wonâ€™t need to enter them every time. This is usually managed by Git Credential Manager.

`There are several ways to authenticate and connect to Git remote repositories`
1. HTTPS with Username and Password [deprecated]
   Git used to support connecting via HTTPS with your username and password. However,
   this method is largely deprecated for security reasons.
2. [IMP-COMMON] HTTPS with Personal Access Token (PAT) -> Created by the developer here it is you
3. [IMP-COMMON] SSH
