[ STEPS TO CONNECT LOCAL PROJECT GIT REPO TO Remote GIT Repo(code exist/not exist) 
(Platform - GITHUB, AZURE-DEVOPS etc.)]

# GIT SETUP
1. Install GIT
2. Initialize GIT 
-  (cmd/git bash) go to local project path location using git command [cd /path]
-  run [git init] it will initialize empty local git repository

# CREATE GIT REPOSITORY IN (GITHUB, AZURE-DEVOPS) If GitHub repo not exist 
- copy {project remote url}

# CONNECT TO REMOTE REPOSITORY (GITHUB, AZURE-DEVOPS etc. project code repository) 
* `PUBLIC REPOSITORY`/ `PRIVATE REPOSITORY`
- Setting/Connecting the remote repository does not require authentication. 
  b/c **Important**: You still wonâ€™t see the existing code on GitHub until you perform an action that requires 
  authentication, like pushing your local changes or pulling the existing code.
- Command [git remote add origin {remote-url}] 
  if remote url already exist then we can override the remote url [git remote set-url origin {remote-url}]
- Command to check remote url for push/ pull [Git remote -v]

* `Alternative way {NOT RECOMMENDED}`
-  we can set/connect the remote url using PAT 
-  Command: [git remote set-url origin https://<your-username>:<new-token>@github.com/antu6183/Java-practice.git]
-  Once the remote URL is set with your PAT,I can perform git push or git pull without authentication.
-  Reason not recommended: Using PAT directly in the remote URL can expose your credentials in the command 
   history and logs, creating a security risk. any more reasons are there I will write later.


[ STEPS TO CONNECT EXISTING PROJECT (local code not exist we will update the existing code)]

# GIT CLONE
  Command: [git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git]
- `public repository` no authentication is required.

- `private repository` you may need to authenticate using your GitHub credentials/(PAT), depending on your setup. 
*  Cloning a private GitHub repository can be done using several ways: 
1. Cloning without PAT
   When prompted for a username and password, use your GitHub username and either your GitHub password or your 
   Personal Access Token (if your account requires PAT).
2. Cloning with SSH
   I will check this later
3. Cloning with PAT `Not Recommended`
   Command: [git clone https://<your-username>:<your-token>@github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git]
