# Introduction TO VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM
VCS - Version Control System -> Records the changes made in our code and store in special DB called REPOSITORY
1. Help manage changes files and projects over time
2. allow multiple people to work on the same project without conflicting changes.
3. helps track the history of modification
 
* Types 
1. Local Version Control System
2. Centralize Version Control System -> All the team members will connect the same server/same code and take
                                        latest version of code. issue -> no one can change there code independently, 
                                        if something happens in centralize server all the communication will break.
                                        ex-> SVN , CVS
3. Distributed Version Control System -> Everyone has the copy of the project in local machine. ex-> GIT, Mercurial

# PLATFORM - (i.e GitHub, Azure DevOps, AWS etc) 
These platforms are services that provide cloud-based storage and tools for managing Git repositories and offer 
additional features to help with project collaboration, continuous integration, and deployment.

* GIT remote repository - location where project code is stored and managed remotely, often on cloud services 
                          like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or Azure DevOps.
* Local repository      - The repository on your local machine.

# REPOSITORY
  Special DB which stores Codes
  Git Repo -> stores code changes and history (local/remote)
