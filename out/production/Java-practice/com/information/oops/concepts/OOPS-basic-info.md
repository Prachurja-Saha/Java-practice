Advantage of OOPS over Procedure-oriented
1) OOPs makes development and maintenance easier, whereas, in a procedure-oriented programming language, 
it is not easy to manage if code grows as project size increases.
2) OOPs provides data hiding, whereas, in a procedure-oriented programming language, 
global data can be accessed from anywhere.
